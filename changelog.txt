TODO:
- add non-confidential results into presentation
- add header to measurements
- plot from startrow only (measure from startrow only?)
- get rid of test limit (currently only one offchain and one onchain possible)
- try other models besides linear for prediction
- try to combine unspent txo

Changes in 1.0:
- removed confidential data (including everything for Maas)
- removed commit history as well
- updated presentation format and README

Changes in 0.7.1:

- minor edits before temporarily final commit, no changes in functionality

Changes in 0.7:
- added presentation

Changes in 0.6.4:
- comparison between 64K and 128K in the works
- added runs/ to misc/

Changes in 0.6.3:
- added filter to learnDiskUsage.py for specific txSize only
- downgraded back to MultiChain alpha 3 version
- added miscellaneous subdir and more data for 128KB both on and offchain
- merged predictApprox and predict as well as plot and plotDetailed

Changes in 0.6.2:
- creating and saving testfiles directory in data instead of parent
- separate file for plotting the test results

Changes in 0.6.1:
- fixes in prediction regarding mastersuball
- added more test data

Changes in 0.6:
- allows for learning offchain and onchain growth from past tests

Changes in 0.5.1:
- added (formated) data from past runs
- added unit flexibility to plotting disk space usage
- added documentation in approximate disk usage

Changes in 0.5:
- integrated choice of pseudorandom transaction matrix
- added preliminary predictions based on yearly transactions
- added baseimage and updated to Multichain alpha 4 version

Changes in 0.4.2:
- made detailed disk usage optional, to be toggled on in params.py

Changes in 0.4.1:
- measuring detailed disk usage of nodes
- preliminary plotting of detailed disk usage with plotDiskUsage.py

Changes in 0.4:
- moved helper functions from benchmark.py to helpers.py
- replaced examples with more recent runs
- removed center time as a variable

Changes in 0.3.3:
- streamlined plotting, now supporting a list of durations to plot for
- updated params.py in the examples to new layout
- updated README
- fix: fixed units for lin reg
- fix2: adjusted runchain.sh from master, fixed issue with measuring chain size

Changes in 0.3.2:
- added sample extended plots to both examples
- increased transparency of all lines
- added README

Changes in 0.3.1:
- completed rudimentary working version of extending the plot using linreg

Changes in 0.3:
- plotting uses numpy arrays instead of lists, started working on linreg
- dynamic use of units for disk space and time
- parameterized time at which measurements are zeroed
- fixed accuracy of measurement intervals (again)
- adjusted runchain.sh and deleted blocknotify.sh
- updated measurements.csv to new format in examples/testfiles-offchain

Changes in 0.2:
- changed uuid size to 10 (definitive) instead of 9
- changed scale of plot from KB to GB
- fixed accuracy of measurement intervals
- adjusted pause after stream creation, moved to createStreams()
- general stylistic clean up

Changes in 0.1:
- added tail in getMeasurements()
- adjusted pause after stream creation
- replaced os.system with subprocess (reading disk size), subprocess.Popen by subprocess.call
- deleted unneeded imports (json, ast), rearranged
- cleaned up single/double quotes
